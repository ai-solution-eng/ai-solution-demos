# Assets Folder

This folder contains various assets used in a project where we used a vision language model deployed in PCAI to extract insights from RTSP streams. 

## Context on customer and use case 

This customer runs a chain of vehicle inspection centers in Latin America. Their goal in engaging with us was to modernize their facilities and automate current processes around auditing, surveillance, and control of the inspection process. They were looking to use AI to extract metadata about the vehicles in their facilities and make that metadata available to analysts and downstream processes.
